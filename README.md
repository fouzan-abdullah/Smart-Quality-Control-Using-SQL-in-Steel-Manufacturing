### Steel-Manufacturing-Quality-Database
Designed and implemented a defect-tracking system for a steel manufacturing process using a normalized relational database and SQL-based analytics.

Key Features:

    Built a defect-detection database in Microsoft Access with relational tables for Plates, Faults, Luminosity, and Box Dimensions; normalized schema to 4NF for data integrity.

    Executed complex SQL queries (INNER/LEFT JOINs, GROUP BY, aggregate filters) to analyze defect patterns by plate type, luminosity range, and dimensional deviations.

    Identified high-fault areas and statistical thresholds for predictive quality control, enabling actionable recommendations for waste reduction and process tuning.

Tools & Skills: SQL, Microsoft Access, Database Normalization, Quality Analytics, Process Optimization
